      <p class="small">These Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms") govern all shipping, logistics, and transportation services ("Services") provided by <strong>[Bravo Shipping Company]</strong> ("the Company", "we", "us", or "our"). By booking or using our Services, the client ("Customer", "you") agrees to be bound by these Terms.</p>

      <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shipment</strong> – Cargo, goods, or items handled by the Company.</li>
        <li><strong>Carrier</strong> – Any third-party transport provider contracted by us (airline, shipping line, trucking service).</li>
        <li><strong>Consignee</strong> – The party receiving the shipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Shipper/Sender</strong> – The party sending the shipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Bill of Lading / Air Waybill</strong> – Official transport document for the shipment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
      <p>We provide air, sea and road freight services, warehousing, customs clearance, cargo handling, last-mile delivery, and related logistics services. We may subcontract carriers, agents or partners to perform all or part of the Services.</p>

      <h2>3. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide complete and accurate shipment details (weight, dimensions, contents, value).</li>
        <li>Ensure packaging is suitable for transit and complies with industry safety standards.</li>
        <li>Provide all required customs and regulatory documentation.</li>
        <li>Ensure the goods are legally permitted for export, import, and transport.</li>
        <li>Pay all charges associated with the shipment in the agreed timeframes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Prohibited &amp; Restricted Goods</h2>
      <p>The Customer must not ship items prohibited under IATA, IMO, or local customs laws. Prohibited goods commonly include explosives, illegal substances, counterfeit items, and undeclared hazardous materials. Restricted goods may require prior written approval and specific packaging/documentation.</p>

      <h2>5. Liability &amp; Insurance</h2>
      <p>The Company’s liability is limited to standard carrier liability rules unless additional insurance is purchased. We are not liable for delays due to weather, strikes, governmental actions, or other force majeure events. Loss or damage caused by inadequate packaging, incorrect documentation, or the Customer’s acts is excluded from our liability. Cargo insurance is available on request for an additional fee.</p>

      <h2>6. Delivery &amp; Transit Times</h2>
      <p>Transit times are estimates and not guaranteed unless explicitly agreed in writing. Delays caused by customs clearance, port/airport congestion, or other third-party factors do not constitute breach by the Company. The consignee may be required to provide identification or sign on delivery.</p>

      <h2>7. Charges &amp; Payments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Charges are calculated on actual or volumetric weight, whichever is greater.</li>
        <li>Additional charges may apply for storage, demurrage, customs duties, inspections, re-delivery, or address changes.</li>
        <li>Payment must be made prior to release of the shipment unless a credit arrangement exists.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Customs Clearance</h2>
      <p>The Company may act as agent for customs clearance. Customs authorities may inspect or detain goods. All duties, taxes, fines, or penalties levied by customs or other authorities are the Customer’s responsibility.</p>

      <h2>9. Claims &amp; Complaints</h2>
      <p>All claims for loss or damage must be notified to the Company and relevant carrier promptly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visible damage: within 24 hours of delivery.</li>
        <li>Concealed damage: within 7 days of delivery.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Claims must include supporting evidence (photos, documents, proof of value). The Company will investigate and liaise with the carrier; settlement is subject to carrier terms and limits.</p>

      <h2>10. Return &amp; Refusal of Shipment</h2>
      <p>We may refuse or return shipments that contain prohibited goods, are improperly packaged, have fraudulent or incomplete documentation, or where charges remain unpaid. Costs for return or disposal of such shipments are payable by the Customer.</p>

      <h2>11. Right of Inspection</h2>
      <p>We and our carriers reserve the right to open and inspect shipments for safety, security, or regulatory compliance without prior notice.</p>

      <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company is not liable for indirect, special, punitive, or consequential losses including loss of profits or business interruption. The Company’s total liability for loss or damage is limited to the amount stated in the relevant transport document or as provided by applicable law.</p>

      <h2>13. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate Services if the Customer breaches these Terms, provides false information, attempts to ship illegal goods, or fails to pay outstanding charges. Termination does not remove the obligation to pay accrued charges.</p>

      <h2>14. Governing Law &amp; Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>[Insert Country]</strong>. Disputes shall be resolved in the courts of <strong>[Insert Jurisdiction]</strong>, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
